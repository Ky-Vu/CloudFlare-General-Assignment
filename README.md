# CloudFlare-General-Assignment
This assignment was created with the help of a tutorial series from [Joel Thoms](https://joel.net/key-value-storage-with-cloudflare-workers-kv-lesson-4). It is incomplete as the tests for getting raw JSON from the free [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) have not been verified to be working as intended due to a 500 Internal Server error.
